This repository hosts a small static demo that shows text zooming toward
the viewer as you scroll. The page uses `style.css` for styling and
`script.js` for the scroll animation.

## Viewing the demo

No build step is needed. Open `index.html` in your web browser
(double‑click the file or run `open index.html`/`xdg-open index.html` on
your OS). Scroll down the page to watch each line of text animate.

## Files

- `index.html` – the main HTML page
- `style.css` – the page styles
- `script.js` – the animation logic

The project is entirely static and serves as a basic scroll demo.
